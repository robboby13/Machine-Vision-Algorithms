Summary: I started this project out of curiousity, there are several links online that can be referenced for lane detection algorithms. Most of them are based of the Udacity Self-Driving Course which I plan to take in the coming months. 

For this canny.py is the file that will need to get compiled for the python lane detection algorithm to work. All images have been included.

Future changes should include trying this with different road images, I am curious to see how the results will change since most the tutorials out there seem to have the same images which include, or atleast seem to be, freshly painted lane markings. Typically not the case here in Michigan. Additionly, there is currently no curvature calulation, meaning when ever the vehicle goes around a curve the lane detection algorithm lacks the necessary performance to report accurate values when going around a curve.
